## Learnings
Milestones covered so far:
1. Developed QR code generation API: This milestone provided hands-on experience in building an API that translates data into QR codes, contributing to a deeper understanding of backend development.
   
2. Developed QR Code scanner API: Building the API for QR code scanning enhanced my knowledge of integrating external components and extracting data from QR codes.
   
3. Drafted UI for QR Generation: Designing the UI underscored the importance of user-centric interfaces, and learnt how to implement the package QR-Code via npm and nodeJS.
