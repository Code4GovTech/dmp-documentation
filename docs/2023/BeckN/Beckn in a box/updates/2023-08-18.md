### [Pull Request 5](https://github.com/beckn/beckn-in-a-box/pull/21) 

## Contributions
- **Backend Design Blueprint**: A comprehensive blueprint outlining the architecture's structure, components, data flow, and interaction patterns.

- **User Management**: Robust user signup and signin functions ensure a secure and seamless user experience.

- **Component Communication**: Effective communication channels facilitate seamless data exchange between application components.

- **MySQL Database Integration**: MySQL integration securely stores user data while adhering to the required schema.

- **Authentication Layer**: An integrated authentication layer ensures secure access, safeguarding user interactions and API access.

- **Authenticated API Calls**: Functionality for authenticated API calls enhances security and control over access.


## Learnings
In this PR, I successfully implemented the backend architecture, enhancing user experience through the integration of components such as Dashboard, API Keys, SDKs, Plugins, and a Wizard. Key achievements include enable efficient communication between various application components. Store user inputs in a MySQL database for data persistence, establish an authentication layer to ensure secure user access, achieve Level 1 integration by allowing API calls with authenticated API keys. Log all API calls in a MongoDB database for auditing. It gave me a thorough understanding how backend architectures are built.
