## Learnings
Through successfully building the BAP SDK CLI tool and integrating it with the BAP search component, I acquired hands-on experience in creating powerful tools that streamline development workflows. The process of taking user prompts and generating template code in the working directory enhanced my understanding of handling user interactions and file manipulation.
