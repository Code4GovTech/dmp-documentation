## Learnings
I was already familiar with setting up a server using Node.js and performing CRUD operations in MongoDB, as well as setting up React Native UI templates. However, it was my first time setting up a development environment using TypeScript. I learned a lot about the benefits of TypeScript and understood why it is widely used in the industry compared to plain JavaScript.

TypeScript utilizes data types to analyze our code for errors during compile time rather than runtime. It allows developers to annotate code with optional strong typing, providing type safety. This feature enables developers to easily understand the values flowing around in the codebase, making TypeScript code more readable and maintainable than JavaScript.
