## Contributions
- Dockerized the whole component i.e. Jenkins server, Vault and Private Registry in the Docker compose file(docker-compose.yml) which allows other users to quickly recreate the environment.

- Mounted ansible roles, jenkins volume & docker socket so that docker container can communicate with daemon

- PR: https://github.com/SamagraX-RCW/devops/pull/5

## Learnings

- Dockerized multiple components (Jenkins server, Vault, and Private Registry) using Docker Compose, enabling a portable and reproducible development environment.

- Integrated Ansible for configuration management and automated provisioning of components.

- Established communication between Jenkins and Docker daemon through mounted volumes.

- Practiced collaboration and version control with pull requests on GitHub.

- Emphasized Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) principles for faster software delivery.

- Adopted Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) practices for consistent and reliable environment setup.
