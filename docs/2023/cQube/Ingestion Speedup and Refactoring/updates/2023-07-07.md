## Learnings

- I installed the necessary dependencies and tools for local development. I cloned the cQube-ingestion repository from the version control system to my local machine. I verified that cQube-repo is running correctly on my local machine.


- I thoroughly explored the cQube-ingestion repo and its documentation to understand its structure and functionality. I started using cQube locally and tested various features and functionalities.


- I added a new config parameter under the globals section in the config.json file to ensure when ingesting data for datasets or dimensions, it allows defining the CSV Delimeter. Also wrote the unit test case for the same and increased the test coverage for the csvreader.ts file to 95 .
