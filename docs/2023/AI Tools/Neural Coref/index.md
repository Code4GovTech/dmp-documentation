# Project Description

**Initial scope:**

During conversation with a chatbot, the user may refer to previous chatbot answers or his earlier questions either implicitly or explicitly. The goal is to take the user's question and resolve the contextual references before passing to a retrieval model for getting more accurate/relavant documents.

**Project scope update:**

Automate synthetic data generation and finetuning process for various NLP tasks via requests to api endpoints and a frontend.
