## Contributions
The chunking API is completed by my mentor Gautam Rajeev and [here's the PR link.](https://github.com/Samagra-Development/ai-tools/pull/223).
After this due to time constrains, the 2nd milestone is still not completed so I will be working on it in 5th week.

## Learnings
- How to manage time and how to ask for help when need because I am currently having a busy schedule in my job.
