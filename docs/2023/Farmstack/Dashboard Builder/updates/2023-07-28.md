## Milestones
- I have created a sidebar which when opened displays the created measures if created any
- I have updated the form component
- I created a create measure button enabled in the form which creates measure in the measures sidebar when the form is submitted.
- Measures side bar contains a list view of measures created .
- When we click on the measures , a new page opens which contains the list of measures.
- I have enabled delete option so that the users can delete the specific measure.

Feedback from Reviewer:-
He suggested me to show the dynamic website for different datasets.
I was also suggested to show the demo working with the actual website(I have given the demo using codesandbox).
He suggested us to write a reusable and testable code so that it can be more scalable.
