## Milestones
- **Restructure of the Code:** Revamping of the widget's code structure to enhance readability, maintainability, and extensibility. This involves reorganizing components, optimizing dependencies, and improving overall code quality.

- **Additional Filter Dependency:** Extending the widget's functionality by introducing supplementary filters that interact with primary categories. This enhancement significantly enriches the search experience by allowing users to fine-tune their searches with a wider range of filtering options, ultimately leading to more accurate and relevant search results.

- **Different Frameworks Configuration:** Configure the widget to seamlessly integrate with various frameworks, ensuring cross-compatibility and flexibility. This milestone addresses the challenge of adapting the widget's functionality to different technology stacks used within the Sunbird Ed ecosystem.
