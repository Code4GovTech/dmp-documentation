## Learnings
- [x] In week 7, I deepened my understanding of the query requirements for our API endpoints. This involved getting a solid grasp of the necessary data inputs and parameters. Simultaneously, I focused on integrating our UI with these API endpoints. By studying API calls and communication methods like Axios and GraphQL clients, I learned how to seamlessly link frontend and backend functionalities. This understanding enhances my ability to contribute effectively and collaborate efficiently with the team moving forward.
