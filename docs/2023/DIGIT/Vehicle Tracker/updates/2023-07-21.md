The Vehicle Tracking is one of the main feature of the app. It will help the user to track the vehicle to monitor illegal activities. Currently, the feature is in the development phase and will be completed in the next week. As of now I have only developed some of it and have tested it out with an android emulator by mimicking the location. Here is a flow diagram of the feature:
