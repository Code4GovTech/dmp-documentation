## Contributions

I helped fix the chatbot's communication, wrote clear documentation, created test cases for the socket connection, and stored message data using Redux.
During this process, I collaborated closely with the team to ensure smooth integration. My efforts led to improved system reliability and user experience.

## Learnings

I learned the need for an effective documentation, also explored deeply socket.io and redux. I also learned how to write test cases for socket connection logic and use playwright to test the testcases in the project.
