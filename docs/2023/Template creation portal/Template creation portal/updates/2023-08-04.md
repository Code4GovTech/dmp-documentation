## Learnings

- Template Structure Configurable method

As template structure can change in the future, I made the model of template structure modifiable using APIs and MongoDB. I used version field in mongoDB to keep track of versioning of templates

- Datatype handling in Angular Dynamic form

As Dynamic form is meant to deal with different Input fields. Input field can take different type of values like dropdown, date-picker, Number and alphabets only.
