## Learnings
Last week we realised that we need to look for a new platform since wati had technical issues, I researched and tarted working with Manychat, developing a manychat bot over dialogflow intents was easy but it needed a middleman to deploy the bot, most of the plaforms available were paid and were not going with the pricing range for Trustin.
