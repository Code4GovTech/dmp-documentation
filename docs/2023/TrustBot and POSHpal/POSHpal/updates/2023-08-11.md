## Learnings
Learnt about different ways to build a whatsapp bot, learnt about dialogflow integration with different whatsapp platforms. Understood the basic frameowkr of multilingual chat bot.

## Summary
Initial plan was to build a whatsapp bot using Dialogflow and Wati using the same agents which were used in building POSHpal, but due to some issues on Wati's end Trustin decided to revoke their subscription and thereofore I was aksed to find new model, keeping the pricing in mind. I spent the week researching over different platforms and building a TestBot on manychat, which was the most apt platform found.
