Title: Week 6
Author: Manika Jain

## Milestones
- [x] Continue the work on ABDM APIs specific to "Discovery and Linking Workflows" and handle the output data based on the application's needs.
- [x] Complete the service layer for the HRP (Health Repository Provider). This layer plays a pivotal role in making calls to the Wrapper and ABDM to retrieve and invoke patient data and information.
- [x] Complete the code for Linking APIs (through 4 different methods of authentication)
- [x] Breaking down the code into modular chunks for the team to take reference from (designed the Controllers, Unit test cases using JUnit and Mockito, etc).
- [x] Understand and create the bridge URL tunnel using Ngrok and Webhooks.
- [x] Working with the new ABHA SBX Application and invoking the "Fetch Records" action.

## Contributions
- Link to second PR: https://github.com/atulai-sg/abdm-sdk/pull/16

## Learnings
- Learned and implemented unit testing frameworks like JUnit and Mockito which helped me ensure the correctness of my code and its individual components.
- Working with the service layer for HRP made me understand the data retrieval mechanisms and interfacing with external systems.
- Working with the different ways of authentication for linking records made me proficient in security and authentication mechanisms.
- Breaking down the code into modular chunks fostered collaboration and maintainability within a development team. It helped with a better code organization, and the importance of creating reusable components.
