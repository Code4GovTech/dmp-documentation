Sunbird Saral attempts to create a connection between the information that exists in the physical world and ties it to digital structured information. Saral literally means simplicity, has been conceptualized to enable users to create structured digital information using mobile devices. The process is also called Saralify or Phygitization. Saral should be viewed as an OCR-plus application that is capable of doing OCR and can also understand the structure of the physical input.
